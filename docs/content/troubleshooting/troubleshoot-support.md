F5 NGINX Ingress Controller adheres to the support policy detailed in the following knowledge base article: [K000140156](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000140156).

In order to open a support ticket, F5 would like additional information to better understand the problem.

The [nginx-supportpkg-for-k8s](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-supportpkg-for-k8s) plugin collects the information needed by F5 Technical Support to assist with troubleshooting your issue.

The plugin leverages [krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io), the plugin manager for the Kubernetes [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) command-line tool.

The plugin may collect some or all of the following global and namespace-specific information:

* k8s version, nodes information, and CRDs
* Pods' logs
* list of Pods, events, ConfigMaps, Services, Deployments, Daemonsets, StatefulSets, ReplicaSets, and Leases
* k8s metrics
* helm Deployments
* `nginx -T` output from NGINX-related pods

This plugin **does not** collect secrets or coredumps.

Please visit the [projectâ€™s GitHub repo](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-supportpkg-for-k8s) for further details.

When used, the plugin will generate a tarball of the collected information which can be shared via the support channels.
